   - Enhanced Prefetcher component with intelligent route prediction
   - Added priority-based loading for important resources
   - Implemented lazy loading for heavy components

2. **Performance Tools**
   - Added bundle analysis capabilities for monitoring
   - Created scripts for automatic performance testing
   - Set up Lighthouse integration for CI/CD

3. **Asset Optimization**
   - Added tools for image compression and optimization
   - Created scripts for generating optimized PWA icons
   - Implemented proper MIME types and caching for static resources

## Bundle Size Analysis

Our production build produced the following optimized chunks:

| Chunk | Size | Gzipped Size |
|-------|------|--------------|
| pdf-vendor | 577.58 kB | 166.96 kB |
| mantine-core | 255.48 kB | 75.81 kB |
| index | 184.17 kB | 59.04 kB |
| index.es | 155.46 kB | 50.68 kB |
| data-vendor | 96.19 kB | 24.37 kB |
| react-vendor | 88.42 kB | 29.15 kB |
| mantine-extras | 30.91 kB | 10.09 kB |

The total bundle size (excluding images) is approximately 1.63MB (uncompressed) or 420KB (gzipped), which is well within reasonable limits for a modern web application.

The largest chunk is pdf-vendor, which contains libraries for PDF generation. Since this is only used in specific parts of the application, it's loaded on-demand through our prefetching strategy, ensuring it doesn't block initial page load.

## Key Recommendations

Based on our optimization work, we recommend the following practices for ongoing development:

1. **Continue Code Splitting**
   - Maintain the current chunking strategy
   - Further split large vendor chunks (especially pdf-vendor)
   - Use dynamic imports for components that aren't needed immediately

2. **Monitoring and Budgets**
   - Set up size budgets for each chunk
   - Add performance monitoring to the CI/CD pipeline
   - Regularly run Lighthouse tests to track Core Web Vitals

3. **Asset Optimization**
   - Keep using the image optimization pipeline
   - Consider WebP/AVIF formats for better compression
   - Apply proper caching strategies for all static assets

4. **Runtime Performance**
   - Profile and optimize any performance bottlenecks
   - Implement proper loading states and skeletons
   - Consider using Web Workers for heavy computations

## Known Issues

- Some Vite plugins are not fully compatible with Vite 6.3.5
- The advanced asset naming patterns require more testing
- PWA manifest icons need to be generated for the application
