## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (v10 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/saga-spells.git
   cd saga-spells
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173

### Building for Production

To create an optimized production build:

```bash
pnpm build:prod
```

## CI/CD Workflows

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment:

### Main CI Workflow

- Runs type checking, testing, and building in parallel jobs
- Uses dependency caching for faster workflow execution
- Uploads test coverage and build artifacts
- Optimized for PNPM and modern Node.js

### Performance Testing

- Runs Lighthouse performance tests automatically
- Generates detailed reports with performance metrics
- Adds report summaries as PR comments
- Enforces performance, accessibility, and PWA standards

### Security Scanning

- Automatically scans dependencies for vulnerabilities
- Creates GitHub issues for critical security problems
- Runs on schedule and when dependencies change

### Deployment Options

We've set up automated deployment to two platforms:

- **GitHub Pages**: Zero-configuration deployment with GitHub's hosting
- **Cloudflare Pages**: High-performance global CDN deployment

See [CI_CD.md](./CI_CD.md) for detailed information about our CI/CD setup.

## Development

To run these workflows locally before pushing:

```bash
# Run tests
pnpm test

# Build the app
pnpm build

# Run Lighthouse tests
pnpm lighthouse
```

For more details on the CI/CD setup, see [CI_CD.md](CI_CD.md).
For deployment instructions, see [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md).

This will:
- Clean the previous build
- Type check all TypeScript code
- Bundle and optimize all assets
- Apply code splitting and lazy loading
- Compress assets (Gzip and Brotli)
- Optimize images
- Generate bundle analysis (available at dist/stats.html)

To preview the production build locally:

```bash
pnpm preview
```

## Usage

### Viewing Spells

The main page displays all available spells. Use the filter panel to narrow down spells by:
- Spell class
- School of magic
- Complexity level
- Keywords
- Text search

### Creating Spellbooks

1. Navigate to the Spellbooks page
2. Click "New Spellbook"
3. Enter a name, character name, and optional description
4. Add spells to your spellbook from the main spells page

### Exporting

- Export individual spells or entire spellbooks to PDF
- Customize the export format with different layout options

## Data Storage

All spellbooks are stored in your browser's local storage. To prevent data loss:
- Use the export feature regularly to back up your spellbooks
- Do not clear your browser data without exporting first
