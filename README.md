### Building for Production

To create an optimized production build:

```bash
pnpm build:prod
```

## CI/CD Workflows

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment:

### Main Workflow (`ci.yml`)

- Triggers on pushes to `main` branch and pull requests
- Installs dependencies with pnpm
- Runs tests with Vitest
- Builds the application

### Release Workflow (`release.yml`)

- Triggers when a new release is published
- Builds the application
- Creates a ZIP artifact of the build
- Attaches the artifact to the GitHub release

### Lighthouse CI (`lighthouse.yml`)

- Runs Lighthouse performance tests
- Generates reports for Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO, and PWA

To run these workflows locally before pushing:

```bash
# Run tests
pnpm test

# Build the app
pnpm build

# Run Lighthouse tests
pnpm lighthouse
```

For more details on the CI/CD setup, see [CI_CD.md](CI_CD.md).
For deployment instructions, see [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md).

This will:
- Clean the previous build
- Type check all TypeScript code
- Bundle and optimize all assets
- Apply code splitting and lazy loading
- Compress assets (Gzip and Brotli)
- Optimize images
- Generate bundle analysis (available at dist/stats.html)

To preview the production build locally:

```bash
pnpm preview
```

## Usage

### Viewing Spells

The main page displays all available spells. Use the filter panel to narrow down spells by:
- Spell class
- School of magic
- Complexity level
- Keywords
- Text search

### Creating Spellbooks

1. Navigate to the Spellbooks page
2. Click "New Spellbook"
3. Enter a name, character name, and optional description
4. Add spells to your spellbook from the main spells page

### Exporting

- Export individual spells or entire spellbooks to PDF
- Customize the export format with different layout options

## Data Storage

All spellbooks are stored in your browser's local storage. To prevent data loss:
- Use the export feature regularly to back up your spellbooks
- Do not clear your browser data without exporting first
